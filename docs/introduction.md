# Builds.rs Documentation

The [builds.rs]() service is built by a team of people who are passionate about
all things Rust. Specifically, we believe that the Rust community has produced
an exceptional quality of tooling, and we want to do our little part in making
this tooling available to the massses.  For that reason, we try to create
working binary builds for all crates published on [crates.io]().
