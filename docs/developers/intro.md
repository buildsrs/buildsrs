# Introduction

This section is aimed at developers of [builds.rs][]. If you are looking to
understand the code or be able to add features to it, you should read this
section carefully because it attempts to give you all of the necessary context.

Note that [builds.rs][] is still under heavy development, and as such the
things documented in here may still change. If you notice anything that is
incorrect, feel free to fix it.
