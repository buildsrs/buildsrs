# Getting Started

This section tells you everything you need to know in order to get started developing
for builds.rs. 

Generally, it is easiest to use Linux to develop [builds.rs][], because that generally
makes it much easier to install the tooling needed to build and run it. However, this is
not a requirement.

If you are not using Linux natively, we recommend that you do one of the following:

## macOS

If you are on macOS, building and running [builds.rs][] locally should work.
However, if you do still want to use Linux, we recommend you install
[UTM][utm], which lets you install Linux inside a virtual machine. It is built
on top of QEMU and works good, even on the newer M2 macs.

## Windows

If you are on Windows, we recommend that you enable the [Windows Subsystem for
Linux][wsl] and use that. 
If this does not work for you, an alternative approach is to use a
virtualisation software such as [VirtualBox][virtualbox].


## Issues

If you encounter any issue, feel free to open an [issue report][issues] and we
will look into it. If it is a bug or something incorrect in the documentation,
we will fix it.
