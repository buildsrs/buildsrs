# Testing

In general, this project aims to do as much testing as possible. Some parts of
the system might be tricky to test, and that is okay. But whenever possible and
sensible, unit tests are used to not only ensure that the behaviour is correct
now, but also that it does not regress in the future as more features are
added.

This guide will explain the different components of the project thus far, and
how tests can be written for them.
